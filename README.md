# About
Hello, I am **Tiyen** (aka. Sniffier or Shreni, whatever). I am a teenage programmer, and a daily Linux user, who is interested in seeing and contributing to the code of others. I am from the Republic of Molossia in Nevada, USA.
My main interests are of course, programming, and linux, not also that but also interested in Abrahamic theology and some areas of fitness (yeah thats very unlikely).
I have AD. It buffs and nerfs some parts of my brain, but I'm okay with it.

---

Uh, no offense, but I don't like people who evangelize Linux.
**Note:** Due to a specific individual (wont disclose the name) and some anomalous stuff that happened in Discord in late 2024 (for some weird reason I don't know of), there may not but might be some people making conspiracies about me in my name. If you encounter them, **don't** believe in it.
## Programming
- My programming languages are:
  - Javascript/Typescript (abandoned)
  - Rust (abandoned)
  - C/C++ (not much knowledge of stdlib)
  - Makefile (only the basics)
  - Lua (learning the C API)
  - Nim (currently learning, will begin using it mainly soon)
  - Bash (only the basics)
- I use:
  - Nix (not NixOS)
  - youtube-dl

## Linux denominations I use
- Linux Mint (in my old pc. Note: I will switch to Fedora soon in place of Mint)
- Termux (my daily driver)
- Arch/Artix linux (on virtual machines)
- Alpine linux (for trying docker images)
- Gentoo (in vms, and for fun)

## My Area of interest:
- Music / Bytebeat
- Reverse Engineering
- Lua
## Inactivity
I usually don't stay active on GitHub due to high school and pressure of studies, but anyways, 
**Wish you all a good day!**
